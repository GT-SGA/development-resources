### Microsoft Azure
Azure offers a variety of cloud computing resources, including the ability to host applications in the cloud, backend hosting (including SQL and NoSQL), and options for machine learning and other AI applications.

Azure has a demo tier, but offers account credit to students through its [Azure Dev Tools for Teaching](https://azureforeducation.microsoft.com/en-us/Institutions) program.


### Amazon Web Services (AWS)
AWS provides cloud hosting and computing services for a variety of applications, including face recognition, machine learning, or just simply hosting some sort of backend application. AWS allows users to select a tier that fits their needs, including options to customize computing power and storage space.

AWS does offer a free tier as well as an [educational program](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/), but Georgia Tech students may want to take advantage of the partnership between GT and AWS, available [here](http://aws.gatech.edu).

### iOS Club
> Aimed to teach key iOS development skills. We believe that the best way to learn is to actually build a product. A huge part of our program will be focusing on having members developing a game of their own and putting it up on the app store. For beginners, building an iOS game is an excellent start because games are universally enjoyable, are easy to program, and are motivationally interesting. The culture of the club will be focused around building a working app to push to the app store.
For students looking to dive head-first into mobile development with Swift and Objective-C, iOS club offers students the opportunity to work on a real project throughout the semester. This gives students valuable hands-on experience in programming and designing applications for a mobile interface, as well as experience working with the Apple toolchain and SDKs.

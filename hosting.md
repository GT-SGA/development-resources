### GT Web Hosting
If you are looking for shared web hosting for your organization's website or simple (client-side) web application, Georgia Tech offers Drupal web hosting as well as Plesk access. Drupal is a content-management-system for websites, while Plesk is a shared hosting solution that allows you to host PHP or HTML/JS websites.

Moe information, as well as the ability to request access to these resources, is available at OIT's official [hosting website](https://hosting.gatech.edu/). To access this website, you must be on-campus or using the Georgia Tech VPN.

### GT Professional Web Presence
Georgia Tech also offers access to managed WordPress blogs, which include several official Georgia Tech themes and a number of plugins. Instead of installing WordPress themselves, users are given access to a WordPress installation where they may add static pages or start a blog.

Although PWP offers less control over the installation than Plesk, it is much easier to get started making a simple website through PWP, as WordPress offers WYSIWYG editors for blog posts and pages.

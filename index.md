## Using this Website

We've collected a number of resources for developing software, including professional IDEs, web hosting, cloud services, and campus organizations. These resources are either provided by Georgia Tech to students at little to no cost or are provided by third-party organizations for free or at a deep discount to all university students.

## Featured Resources

If you're just getting started with developing projects at Georgia Tech, try checking out some of the following resources. If you're looking for something more specific, check out the links at the top of the page.

### Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code, or VS Code for short, is a Microsoft open-source text editor for programming. With out-of-the-box support for CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, VS Code is an excellent editor for web development.

Additionally, an extensive marketplace for extensions allows the editor to offer IDE features for other languages, including code completion, syntax highlighting, code "hinting," compilation error detection, and debugging support.

What is unique about VS Code's IDE features is that many of them take advantage of existing tools for their respective language, allowing users to customize their development process if they so desire.

VS Code is available for free from its [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### GitHub Student Pack
GitHub has partnered with several companies in the programming and development industry to give students access to free or heavily discounted resources to get them started. By signing up for the student pack and verifying current enrollment status, users get access to a number of resources, including but not limited to:
- A free [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) dyno for 2 years
- Bonus [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) credits
- Free private repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com) while a student

Benefits rotate as different companies partner with GitHub, so check their [website](https://education.github.com/pack) for up-to-date information.

### Azure Dev Tools for Teaching
Microsoft recently replaced its Microsoft Imagine program with [Azure Dev Tools for Teaching](https://azureforeducation.microsoft.com/en-us/Institutions), which combines the previously-available Azure student program with the software offered through Microsoft Imagine.

This program offers cloud computing resources to students, as well as free or heavily discounted copies of professional Microsoft software, including Visual Studio and Microsoft Windows Server.

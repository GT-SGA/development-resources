### Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code, or VS Code for short, is a Microsoft open-source text editor for programming. With out-of-the-box support for CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, VS Code is an excellent editor for web development.

Additionally, an extensive marketplace for extensions allows the editor to offer IDE features for other languages, including code completion, syntax highlighting, code "hinting," compilation error detection, and debugging support.

What is unique about VS Code's IDE features is that many of them take advantage of existing tools for their respective language, allowing users to customize their development process if they so desire.

VS Code is available for free from its [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Atom
Atom is an open-source text editor developed by GitHub. Atom supports syntax highlighting for most major languages either out-of-the-box or through extensions installed through the text editor. Atom is also highly customizable, as the program gives power users the ability to add in their own JavaScript or CSS on top of the existing application.

Atom does not offer many typical IDE-like features (code completion, debugging) by default, but there are community projects which add some of this functionality to the text editor.

Atom is available from its [website](https://atom.io/). IDE packages for Atom can be found at a [companion site](https://ide.atom.io/).

### Microsoft Visual Studio
Visual Studio is Microsoft's professional IDE, used primarily for C/C++ and C# development. Visual Studio is tailored for applications made for Windows (including UWP applications) and for applications which take advantage of Microsoft Azure. If you are planning to do serious development for Windows or for Microsoft Azure, Visual Studio offers the necessary tools to integrate with both.

Available from [Azure Dev Tools for Teaching](https://azureforeducation.microsoft.com/en-us/Institutions).

### JetBrains IDEs
JetBrains has IDEs for nearly any modern programming language, including Java (IntelliJ IDEA), C/C++ (CLion), and JavaScript (WebStorm). Their IDEs are used as the basis for Android Studio and feature a complete set of IDE features, including support for popular build tools such as Gradle and Maven.

JetBrains offers community versions of their IDEs for free, which lack professional support and have a slightly-limited feature set. However, they offer free professional licenses for current students, available through their [educational program](https://www.jetbrains.com/education/).
